### Gameplay

- The black box is the you, the Dark Knight.

- Collect Gold and Silver Coins.

- Hitting a fire line, a fire bar or a boomerang (the brown wooden object) will reduce your score.

- Try to collect olive coloured projectiles. They will give you more coins.

- You can traverse the semi circle only in a semi circular path and cannot use thrusters while in the semi circle. It also serves as a safe zone.

- Use water balloons to extinguish fires and earn points. Remember that you can use a maximum of 100 balloons.

- Sky coloured magnets will appear randomly and draw you towards itself. Once you collide with the magnet, the magnet shatters and you are free once more.

- Avoid the snowballs thrown by Viserion, a Swedish Short Snout Dragon. If Viserion touches you, there is a heavy penalty and you perish. Also, water balloons do no damage to Viserion.

- Reach the end to conclude the game and receive your final score.

- On reaching a score of 2500, your level will go up and you will have a shield power up for 15 seconds. Go through your enemies during this time frame and there will be no penalties. On reaching level 2, you have to deal with automatic panning. Going left will become difficult and you will have to deal with the constant movement.

#### All the best and have a fun ride.
